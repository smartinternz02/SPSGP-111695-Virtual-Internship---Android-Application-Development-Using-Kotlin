/*
* Summary
    View binding lets you more easily write code that interacts with the UI elements in your app
    The Double data type in Kotlin can store a decimal number.
    Use the checkedRadioButtonId attribute of a RadioGroup to find which RadioButton is selected.
    Use NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance() to get a formatter to use for formatting numbers as currency.
    You can use string parameters like %s to create dynamic strings that can still be easily translated into other languages.
    Testing is important!
    You can use Logcat in Android Studio to troubleshoot problems like the app crashing.
    A stack trace shows a list of methods that were called. This can be useful if the code generates an exception.
    Exceptions indicate a problem that code didn't expect.
    Null means "no value."
    Not all code can handle null values, so be careful using it.
    Use Analyze > Inspect Code for suggestions to improve your code.

/*
*
* Sometimes all you need is clean and rebuild the project.

Build -> Clean Project
Build -> Rebuild Project

This would be enough for generating the binding classes.
